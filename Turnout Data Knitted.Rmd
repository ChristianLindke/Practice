## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r turnout}
## Install qss

#install.packages("qss")
#library(qss)
#library(readr)

## Bring Turnout Data into Global Environment

data("turnout", package = "qss")

```

It is also very easy to make tables with knitr's `kable` function:

```{r turnouttable, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(turnout, caption = "A knitr kable of turnout data.")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
numfelons <- turnout$felons
elecyear <- turnout$year
plot(y = numfelons, x = elecyear)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Now it is time to load the RESUME data to work on Imai's Chapter 2

```{r resume}
data("resume", package = "qss")

dim(resume)
head(resume)
summary(resume)
```

Now that we've loaded the data, let's take a look at its head as a `kable`:


```{r resumeinfo, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
resume2 <- head(resume)
kable(resume2, caption = "This knitr kable shows some resume data from Imai's QSS Examples")

```

Now let's load some Arsalyn Data!

```{r arsalyn, echo=FALSE}
arsalyn1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianLindke/datasharing/master/2020%20Primary%20Election%20Ballot%20Verified%20Results%20duplicated%20deleted%20Comma.csv")

arsalyn2 <- head(arsalyn1[,2:9])

kable(arsalyn2, caption = "This is a table using Arsalyn Data")

```
